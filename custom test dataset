best movie ever seen !!
i removed my eyeballs from my head as soon as i got back from movie and cleaned them in a sink.
There’s no heart in this movie, no urgency.
This is truly a depressing experience. It’s rare to feel such pity for a major studio movie, but watching “Warcraft” bend over backwards to set up a sequel is like watching a desperate paramedic apply CPR to someone who’s clearly been dead for hours. He’s gone. He’s gone. Let it go.
...brutally cynical, largely unfunny film fueled by muddled social commentary.
“'Man Down' is a bad film, but it’s made even worse by the taste it will leave in your mouth regarding its silly handling of a very serious issue." 
a movie with good message .... hats off to the entire team.
cool movie.
